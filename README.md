This is meant as an archive. Most of the zero-day exploits that i-Ready Overload has used has been patched. For an actually working edition, use notplu/Nullify, or flowingsalt/Flowify. I am not affliated with any of the following users and take no claim to their code at all.

plus i'm banned from the Nullify discord anyway
